# Movement-After-Initial-Compromise-Slides
@SleepZ3R0 @HA12TL3Y We are both passionate members of the Red Teaming Community and we recently spoke at BsidesAugusta and BsidesRDU. We wanted to share these slides with the public after a few people requested we do so. Feel free to message us on Twitter. We love talking to other people who love this field!
